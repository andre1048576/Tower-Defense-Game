This is an old game i made back in 2018 for a school project
While it is horribly outdated, both in graphics and in coding, I'm keeping it as it is for archival purposes.
It is also horribly obtuse, as I was rushed for the deadline.


Tips for running it:
Do not enter full screen, as that breaks the application.
The aspect ratio is weird; that's intentional. Please do not try to modify it.
You are required to click on the red squares to create a path from the starting square to the ending one (colored differently), and the path may not intersect itself.
It is possible to win by mass producing the 100$ tower and upgrading it one tier.
